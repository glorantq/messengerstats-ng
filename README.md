# MessengerStats NG

This is a rewrite of my previous, unreleased project, that allows you to browse messages in a GDPR data takeout from Meta's Messenger platform, and calculate various statistics on these conversations.

### Features
- Tries to mimic the look of the original platform as closely as possible
- Appearance and behaviour custimisable
- Fully native application written in Qt, with focus on performance
- Everything is processed locally, everything stays on your computer
